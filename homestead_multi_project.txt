memory: 2048
cpus: 1
provider: virtualbox

authorize: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

keys:
    - ~/.ssh/id_rsa

folders:
    - map: /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/laravel_homestead/laravel-homestead/
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/laravel_homestead
    - map: /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/phpMyAdmin
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/phpMyAdmin
    - map: /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/hackathon/
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/hackathon

    - map: homestead.app
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/laravel_homestead/laravel/public
    - map: hackathon.app
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/hackathon/hackathon_tuhao/public
    - map: phpmyadmin.app
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/phpMyAdmin
databases:
    - homestead
    - hackathon

* With folders: when "homestead up" will auto upload code from "map" (local) to "to" (virtual box server)
* With sites: access "map" (homestead.app) will go to public site (/home/vagrant/Code/laravel_homestead)
Step 2:
* config /etc/hosts
192.168.10.10 homestead.app
192.168.10.10 hackathon.app
127.0.01 phpmyadmin.app

Step 3: check result
* run command "homestead up"
* connect virtual box with command "homestead ssh". If you can not connect, please check config authorize 
and keys
* check folder /home/vagrant/Code have existed 3 folders : laravel_homestead, hackathon, phpMyAdmin? if existed =>> success
* check folder /etc/nginx/sites-enabled have existed 3 domains: homestead.app, hackathon.app, phpmyadmin.php
if existed => success.

Notes:
* if you see "no input file specified" please check path config in folders and sites. Maybe wrong path 
* with folder phpMyAdmin (/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/phpMyAdmin) you can download from internet
* You want access page phpMyAdmin: please connect phpmyadmin.app:8000
